# bibleConvert

A converter to https://bible-api.com USFX files. It converts the XMLs (.usfx) to JSON files.

Follow these steps:

# 1 | Create a file named "bible.json" anywhere and set the path on line 15 of Program.cs to it. It is the output file;
# 2 | Download the XML (USFX) u want to convert from https://github.com/seven1m/open-bibles. Save it anywhere;
# 3 | Change line 26 of Program.cs to step 2 file path;
# 4 | Run Program.cs.

I tried to make the code functional before turning it into a beauty code, so i know it needs a lots of refactoring and polishing.
